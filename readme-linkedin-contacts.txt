iPhone LinkedIn Contacts
------------------------

This demo application displays the list of your LinkedIn contacts in an iPhone HMTL5 web application.
It stores the contacts in the browser's database and caches the application files for offline access.
The application uses jQuery and jQtouch to reproduce the native iPhone look and feel.

Optimized for the iPhone Safari browser.

Setup Instructions

In order to run the application on your tenant, you must create an API Key on LinkedIn's developer website.
Go to https://www.linkedin.com/secure/developer and login with your LinkedIn account.
Generate a key for the URL that will make the API calls (eg: http://tenant.cloud-ide.com).
Copy the key in the placeholder in mobile.html. 
You can now oget the URL of your mobile.html thanks to the view menu and display it in your mobile browser.
